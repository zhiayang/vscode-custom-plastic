# Change Log

All notable changes to the _Plastic_ theme will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.11.0] - 2018-05-21

* I have been testing a new version for some time and am nearly ready to release
  Plastic v2!
  * Most colours have been tweaked to match their name on
    [Chirag's website](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/). e.g. Whiskey
    is now a solid whiskey colour instead of an approximation. This gives a more
    vibrant feel and better contrast.
  * Added an easier method to configure the theme. Now there's three config
    files: the colour names, syntax, and workbench configurations. A build
    script runs through these and outputs the resulting theme file in the themes
    folder. Clone the repo and try it yourself using `yarn build`.
  * The scope (syntax) have been simplified further, using (even more!) generic
    rules. I've tried to keep the scopes to two levels of specification, with a
    maximum of three if necessary.

Note: v2 will soon become the next version of Plastic so please provide
feedback. v1 will no longer be maintained and will eventually be removed. This
is due to the new way that the theme is built and configured (see above). This
theme will also no longer provide a deprioritised-punctuation version. However,
after v2 has been finalised, I will start a _Plastic Forks_ program, and will
add in a Plastic-Deprioritised-Punctuation theme as its first entry. If you rely
on this variation, I suggest sticking with the legacy version for now (I won't
remove it until the new one is released).
